# balena-pihole

If you're looking for a way to quickly and easily get up and running with a Pi-hole device for your home network, this is the project for you.

This project is a [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud) stack with the following services:

* [Pi-hole](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole/) (including [PADD](https://github.com/jpmck/PADD))
* [dnscrypt-proxy](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy) _(optional)_

balenaCloud is a free service to remotely manage and update your Raspberry Pi through an online dashboard interface, as well as providing remote access to the Pi-hole web interface without any additional configuation.

## Getting Started

You can one-click-deploy this project to balena using the button below:

[![](https://balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy)

## Manual Deployment

Alternatively, deployment can be carried out by manually creating a [balenaCloud account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com) and application, flashing a device, downloading the project and pushing it via either Git or the [balena CLI](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli).

### Device Variables

Device Variables apply to all services within the application, and can be applied fleet-wide to apply to multiple devices. If you used the one-click-deploy method, the default environment variables will already be added for you to customize as needed.

|Name|Example|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|`TZ`|`America/Toronto`|To inform services of the timezone in your location, in order to set times and dates within the applications correctly. Find a [list of all timezone values here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).|
|`DNSMASQ_LISTENING`|`eth0`|We set this to `eth0` to indicate we want DNSMASQ to listen on the ethernet interface of the Raspberry Pi. If you're connecting to your network with WiFi replace this with `wlan0`|
|`INTERFACE`|`eth0`|As above.|
|`WEBPASSWORD`|`mysecretpassword`|_(optional)_ password for accessing the web-based interface of Pi-hole - you won’t be able to access the admin panel without defining a password here.
|`DNS1`|`127.0.0.1#5053`|_(optional)_ Tell Pi-hole where to forward DNS requests that aren’t blocked. We’re using the [dnscrypt-proxy](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy) project here but you can specify your own.|
|`DNS2`|`127.0.0.1#5053`|_(optional)_ Secondary DNS server - see above.|
|`ServerIP`|`x.x.x.x`|_(recommended)_ Set to your server's LAN IP, used by web block modes and lighttpd bind address.|
